This is a simple ASI script that allows you to lock the mouse cursor within a game window. This can be useful for fullscreen games or applications where you want to prevent the cursor from leaving the screen.

To use this script, simply inject it into your game or application using a DLL injector or use something like Ultimate ASI Loader.
